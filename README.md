# Analysis of confidentiality and authorization properties in Intel SGX by Proverif
Using Proverif as a symbolic verification tool the task is to analyze confidentiality and authentication properties of Intel SGX local and remote attestation.

## Model description, attestation flow.
### Intel SGX local attestation:
The Proverif model for local attestation consists of two subprocesses. Each subprocess represents an enclave. Enclave_B is the enclave that sends a challenge message to Enclave_A with its identity. Enclave_A gets the request and constructs a cryptographic report. This report consists of a report body, protection key, and message authentication code (MAC). In the current model, the report body comprises CPUSVN, the personal identity of Enclave_A, and some user data. In order to compute the message-authentication key, Enclave_A needs to make use of the cmac function that must have the following parameters: report body, report key. However, initially, Enclave_A has no report key. Therefore, before calling the cmac function it must call the function named derive_key that returns the report key needed for MAC calculation. Derive_key function takes CPUSVN, protection key, OwnerEpoch, SealFuses, KeyID, and Enclave_B as parameters. The identity of Enclave_B is essential because it is assumed that only the enclave can verify the report for whom this report was created. In other words, if the derive_key function lacked the identity of Enclave_B in its parameters, then Enclave_B would not be able to verify the report, and, therefore, the local attestation procedure would fail. After gathering all required params, the cmac function calculates the message authentication code, and this code is appended to the cryptographic report. This report is sent to the Enclave_B via a public channel. Upon receiving the report, Enclave_B first derives the key by calling the derive_key function. This operation basically returns the same report key. Thereafter, Enclave_B calculates the message authentication code - MAC_OUTPUT using the report it had got from Enclave_A and report key. Finally, Enclave_B compares MAC_OUTPUT with the MAC from Enclave_A. If the result of the comparison is equal, it means that the report was not modified by an attacker, and Enclave_B can verify the report. 
### Intel SGX remote attestation:
The Proverif model for remote attestation contains 5 subprocesses â€“ Remote_Challenger, SGX_Application, SGX_Application_Enclave, Intel_Quoting_Enclave, and Intel_Attestation_Service. This model represents the following attestation flow. Firstly, an application receives a request coming outside of the platform (the message is sent by a remote challenger). After that, the application requests, SGX_Application_Enclave to produce an attestation. The attestation consists of two stages. The first stage is responsible for conducting a local attestation between SGX_Application_Enclave and Intel_Quoting_Enclave. Intel_Quoting_Enclave verifies the local attestation and sign it using its attestation key. The result of signing is stored in the quote variable. Thereafter, the quote and CMAC are sent to SGX_Application. SGX_Application simply forwards this message to Remote_Challenger. Finally, the Remote_Challenger makes use of Intel_Attestation_Service to verify the quote. The quote verification is done by the destructor named checksign. The result of calling this function is sent to Remote_Challenger. Remote_Challenger checks whether the result is true. If it is the case, then Remote_Challenger triggers the event called successful_attestation meaning that the message integrity, message authentication, and nonrepudiation properties are satisfied. 
## Obtained resutls:
The summary result provides the following conclusions. First of all, it is said that the attacker is not able to derive the key using the values it possesses in the case of local and remote attestations. Therefore, confidentiality property is guaranteed. Secondly, the invoked event verified_report in local attestation indicates that symmetric authentication is correct as well as the invoked event successful_attestation in remote attestation shows that the digital signature is valid.
